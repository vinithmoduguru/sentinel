### Project Rules

- **Ticket references**: When mentioning a ticket number (e.g., SEN-19), use Linear MCP for linking, updates, and status changes.
- **Linting**: Ensure all linting errors are resolved before finalizing any change.
- **API validation**: If an API is created or modified, test it with a cURL request and verify expected responses and error cases.
- **Data verification**: If unsure about data, execute read-only SQL queries using the configured database URL to validate assumptions before proceeding.
